/*Since we are making a single page application and we don’t want any page refreshes, we’ll use Angular’s routing capabilities.

Let’s look in our Angular file and add to our application. We will be using $routeProvider in Angular to handle our routing.
This way, Angular will handle all of the magic required to go get a new file and inject it into our layout.

A RESOLVE is a property you can attach to a route in both ngRoute and the more robust UI router. A resolve contains one or more promises that must resolve
successfully before the route will change. This means you can wait for data to become available before showing a view, and simplify the initialization
of the model inside a controller because the initial data is given to the controller instead of the controller needing to go out and fetch the data.


Resolve - te ajuta sa-ti iei info din BD inainte sa intre in controller, ca in controller sa poti sa le folosesti
		- asteapta sa primeasca tot de la promise si abia apoi trece la controller cu toate info gata furnizate
		- sincron
		- se pot crea functii, obiecte, ce mai ai nevoie => in controller ai obiectele deja facute si le poti folosi direct
promise - asincron
