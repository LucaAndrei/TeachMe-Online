# Teach Me

Teach Me Online was the project for my Bachelor's Degree at Universitatea "Dunarea de Jos" Galati, Romania.
<br /><br />
At the time I wasn't studying nor working with web technologies so I decided to go on my own and build a project for my Bachelor's Degree Thesis so I can learn new technologies as well.
<br /><br />
It turned out pretty fine for me because since that moment I knew that Web Development was the path for me to continue in my programming carreer.
Been working as a Software Engineer / Web Developer for quite some time now.
<br /><br />
This is the project with which it all began.
